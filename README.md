# Hospital Management Dashboard (Interactive Excel Project)
## Overview: The Hospital Management Dashboard is an interactive Excel-based analytics project designed to monitor and evaluate the performance of a hospital’s emergency room operations. It presents actionable insights through visual representations of key metrics such as patient admissions, average wait times, satisfaction levels, and departmental referrals. This project was developed as part of my self-learning initiative using YouTube resources, where I implemented advanced Excel functionalities to create a professional, data-driven dashboard from scratch. The dataset used was sourced from the same tutorial reference for educational purposes.

## Objective
To design a dynamic and visually intuitive dashboard that enables hospital management to make data-backed operational decisions by tracking performance indicators across multiple dimensions such as patient demographics, yearly trends, and departmental efficiency.

Key Insights / KPIs
-The dashboard answers several critical business questions, including:
-What is the total number of patients treated each year (2023–2024)?
-What is the average waiting time and how does it vary over time?
-What is the overall patient satisfaction score?
-What percentage of patients were admitted vs. non-admitted?
-Which departments received the highest referrals?
-What is the age-wise distribution of patients in the emergency room?
-Tools & Technologies
-Microsoft Excel
-Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
-Slicers & Interactive Filters
-Conditional Formatting
-Data Cleaning & Transformation Techniques

Skills Demonstrated:
1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2.Dashboard Planning 
3.KPI Identification and Visualization
4.Data Storytelling & Analytical Interpretation
5.Professional Excel Dashboard Design

Dataset: The dataset used for this project was sourced from a YouTube learning tutorial on Excel dashboard development. It contains simulated emergency room data suitable for analytical and visualization practice.

Outcome: 
The final dashboard provides a comprehensive yet accessible overview of hospital performance, allowing management to identify bottlenecks, track patient satisfaction, and optimize operational efficiency through data visualization and insight generation.
